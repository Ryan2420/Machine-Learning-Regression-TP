Machine Learning Regression TP

This repository contains our first Machine Learning project realized as part of the AI Engineering program at UniversitÃ© Djilali LiabÃ¨s de Sidi Bel AbbÃ¨s.

 Overview

We explored and implemented three fundamental regression models:

Simple Linear Regression â€“ using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Gradient Descent methods

Multiple Linear Regression â€“ matrix form solution and comparison with Scikit-learn

Polynomial Regression â€“ modeling non-linear relationships

 Concepts Covered

Analytical solution vs iterative optimization

Model evaluation: RSS, RMSE, RÂ²

Visualization and data interpretation

Comparison with Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression

 Tools & Libraries

Python 3

NumPy

Matplotlib

Pandas

Scikit-learn
